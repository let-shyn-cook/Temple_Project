---

## .github/workflows
Contains **GitHub Actions workflows** to automate tasks, such as:
- `train_model.yml`: Automates model training
- `deploy_model.yml`: Automates model deployment

## ci
Scripts for **continuous integration (CI)** using tools like Jenkins:
- `jenkinsfile`: Defines the CI/CD pipeline.

## config
Stores **project configurations**:
- Hyperparameters for training models
- API keys and secret values

## data
Organizes **datasets** into meaningful subdirectories:
- `raw/`: Unprocessed data (original datasets)
- `processed/`: Data after cleaning and transformation
- `interim/`: Temporary data between steps
- `external/`: External datasets or third-party data sources

## schema
Defines **data schema** for validation and documentation:
- `data_schema.yaml`: YAML file defining the data structure.

## validation
Scripts to **ensure data quality**:
- `validate_data.py`: Script for validating datasets against schema.

## experiments
Tracks and manages **experiments** and their results:
- `mlflow/`: MLflow logs for tracking experiments
- `tensorboard/`: TensorBoard logs for visualization
- `results_history.json`: Summary of previous experiments.

## notebooks
Contains **Jupyter Notebooks** for research, EDA, and analysis:
- `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook
- `model_exploration.ipynb`: Prototyping models.

## models
Organizes **model files** and training artifacts:
- `checkpoints/`: Checkpoints during training
- `final/`: Finalized models
- `logs/`: Training logs
- `results/`: Visual outputs (e.g., confusion matrix, loss curve)
- `serialized/`: Serialized models (e.g., ONNX, TFLite).

## src
Main **source code** of the project, divided into submodules:
- `data/`: Data loading and preprocessing scripts
- `features/`: Feature engineering logic
- `models/`: Model definition and architecture
- `training/`: Model training scripts
- `evaluation/`: Scripts for model evaluation
- `deployment/`: Code for deploying the model.

## tests
Contains **unit tests and integration tests** for the project:
- `test_data.py`: Tests for data processing functions
- `test_model.py`: Tests for model training and inference
- `test_api.py`: Tests for deployed APIs.

## reports
Stores **reports** and visualizations:
- `model_performance.pdf`: PDF report summarizing model performance.

## references
Contains **reference materials**, such as papers or notes:
- `paper_list.md`: List of research papers and resources.

## docker
Contains **Docker-related files** for containerization:
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image
- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration for multi-container services.

## deployment
Stores **deployment-related code** and configurations:
- `api/`: Code for the API
- `k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests
- `swagger/`: Swagger documentation for the API.

## lib
Internal **custom libraries** developed for the project:
- `my_custom_library/`: Python module with reusable functions.

## scripts
Utility **scripts** for various tasks:
- `setup.sh`: Script for setting up the environment
- `monitor.py`: Monitors the deployed model
- `retrain.py`: Retrains the model with new data.

## monitoring
Contains **monitoring scripts**:
- `performance_monitor.py`: Tracks model performance post-deployment.

## docs
Contains **documentation** for the project:
- `api_docs.md`: API documentation.

## examples
Provides **example scripts** demonstrating the use of the project:
- `example_usage.py`: Example usage of the model or API.

## artifacts
Stores **temporary results** generated during training and testing:
- `temp_model_output.pkl`: Pickle file with a temporary result.

## Environment and Dependency Files
These files define the environment and dependencies:
- `.env`: Environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `LICENSE`: License for the project.
- `Makefile`: Automates tasks like setup and testing.
- `README.md`: Introduction and usage guide.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Log of project changes.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Rules for community behavior.
- `SECURITY.md`: Security policies and reporting instructions.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment definition.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `setup.py`: Setup script for packaging the project.
- `tox.ini`: Configuration for testing with multiple Python versions.

## Conclusion
This project structure covers all necessary aspects to ensure a smooth **AI/Data Science project lifecycle**, including:
- Organized datasets and schema validation
- Experiment tracking with MLflow and TensorBoard
- Containerization and deployment-ready code
- Documentation and CI/CD for production-readiness.
